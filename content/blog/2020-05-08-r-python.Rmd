Everyone knows the only way to truly learn something is to relate it back to Harry Potter. Okay, maybe that's not true- but it definitely helps. You all remember Parseltongue, right? Harry (& Voldemort!) used Parseltongue to speak to pythons, so maybe we can use Python to speak Parseltongue? I imagine it would go something like this.

So I tried that with the snake in my backyard- didn't work. But you CAN use another language with Python - R! Turns out they can talk to each other, no snakes involed (much safer).

For example, say you wanted to cast a cute friendship spell as such:
```{R}
library(reticulate)
Voldemort<-"Avada"
```

```{python}
says="Kedavra!"
print(r.Voldemort,says)
```

So easy! I always thought Python was too hard to learn (maybe it's easier for Slytherins?) but knowing I can still use R gives me the safety net I need while I'm still learning.

Now we're going to use this dataset from Dan Martin containing a list of every Harry Potter character. Say we wanted to do something ridiculous like find all the people whose name starts with an H and ends with an R. Let's use both R and Python to do it!

```{R}
#R
HP<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpmartin42/Networks/master/Harry%20Potter/data/HP_links.csv")
head(HP)

library(tidyverse)
HP<-HP%>%select(Label)%>%rename(name=Label)
string <- paste(HP$name, collapse = " , ")
```

```{python}
#python
import re
names=re.findall(r'H[a-zA-Z]+\s[a-zA-Z]+r[^a-z]',r.string)
print(names)
```

There you have it! A totally practical and super realistic application of using both R and Python in RStudio. Now, with so many options you MAY be feeling a little like this guy:

But no fear! At least we all can agree...
