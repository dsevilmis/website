      <description>Everyone knows the only way to truly learn something is to relate it back to Harry Potter. Okay, maybe that’s not true- but it definitely helps. You all remember Parseltongue, right? Harry (&amp;amp; Voldemort!) used Parseltongue to speak to pythons, so maybe we can use Python to speak Parseltongue? I imagine it would go something like this.
So I tried that with the snake in my backyard- didn’t work. But you CAN use another language with Python - R!</description>

      <description>###Write a narrative introductory paragraph or two describing the datasets you have chosen, the variables they contain, how they were acquired, and why they are interesting to you. Expand on potential associations you may expect, if any. For my project, I have selected FiveThirtyEight’s ‘bechel’ dataset and the ‘movies’ dataset from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel at Duke University who gathered the data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes’ websites. The ‘bechdel’ df can be pulled up by downloading/calling the FiveThirtyEight package and the ‘movies’ dataset can be found here: http://www2.</description>

      <description>Deniz Sevilmis - yds255 Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations?
My dataset comes from a University of California Irvine dataset that combines heart disease data from around the world, but I am only using the subset of data that comes from Cleveland, which has also been used in machine learning studies.</description>
