      <description>Everyone knows the only way to truly learn something is to relate it back to Harry Potter. Okay, maybe that’s not true- but it definitely helps. You all remember Parseltongue, right? Harry (&amp;amp; Voldemort!) used Parseltongue to speak to pythons, so maybe we can use Python to speak Parseltongue? I imagine it would go something like this.
So I tried that with the snake in my backyard- didn’t work. But you CAN use another language with Python - R!</description>
